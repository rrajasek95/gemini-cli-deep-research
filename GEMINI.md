# gemini-deep-research

## Project Overview

**gemini-deep-research** is an extension for the Gemini CLI that enables deep research capabilities. It is designed to automate complex research workflows, synthesize information from various sources, and generate detailed reports.

The extension leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to integrate seamlessy with the Gemini CLI environment. It allows users to:
-   Execute multi-step research plans.
-   Integrate with file search databases for grounded research.
-   Generate comprehensive reports with citations.

**Key Technologies:**
-   **Language:** TypeScript (Node.js runtime)
-   **AI SDK:** `@google/genai`
-   **Protocol:** Model Context Protocol (MCP)
-   **Validation:** `zod`

## Building and Running

This project uses standard Node.js/npm commands.

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
-   npm

### Key Commands

*   **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

*   **Build the Project:**
    Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in the `dist/` directory.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

*   **Run the Extension:**
    Builds and starts the extension.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

*   **Run Tests:**
    Executes the test suite using Jest.
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

*   **Linting:**
    Checks code quality using ESLint.
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

## Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:**
    -   Follows standard TypeScript conventions.
    -   Uses **Prettier** for formatting and **ESLint** for linting.
    -   Ensure `npm run lint` passes before committing.

*   **Architecture:**
    -   The project is structured as a Gemini CLI extension using MCP.
    -   **Commands:** Defined in `commands/` using TOML files.
    -   **Source:** logic resides in `src/`.
    -   **Configuration:** `gemini-extension.json` defines the extension metadata and server configuration.

*   **Testing:**
    -   Unit tests are written using **Jest**.
    -   Test files are located alongside source files (e.g., `Filename.test.ts`) or in a dedicated test directory depending on the specific module structure.

## Directory Structure

*   `src/`: Source code for the extension logic.
*   `commands/deep-research/`: TOML definitions for deep research commands.
*   `conductor/`: Product documentation, requirements, and technical specifications.
*   `dist/`: Compiled JavaScript output (generated by build).
*   `gemini-extension.json`: Manifest file for the Gemini CLI extension, defining the MCP server execution.
*   `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
*   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration.
