# gemini-deep-research
A deep research extension for Gemini CLI

## Configuration

To use this extension, you must provide a Google GenAI API key. You can set it using one of the following environment variables (in order of priority):

1.  `GEMINI_DEEP_RESEARCH_API_KEY`
2.  `GEMINI_API_KEY`

If neither is set, the MCP server will exit with an error.
