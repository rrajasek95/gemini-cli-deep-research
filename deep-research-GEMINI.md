# Gemini Deep Research Extension

This extension provides tools for performing Deep Research and managing File Search stores for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It maintains a local workspace state to simplify the research workflow.

## Workspace Caching

The extension automatically manages a `.gemini-research.json` file in the current working directory. This file caches:
-   **Research IDs**: Keeps track of initiated deep research interactions.
-   **File Search Store Mappings**: Maps user-friendly display names to their corresponding cloud resource names (e.g., `fileSearchStores/...`).

**Dependency Note**: Tools that take a `storeName` often expect the full resource name. You can use `file_search_list_stores` to retrieve these from the local cache.

## Available Tools

### File Search Management
- `file_search_create_store`: Create a new store for your documents.
- `file_search_list_stores`: See all your available stores (retrieved from local cache).
- `file_search_upload`: Upload a single file or recursively upload a directory to a store.
- `file_search_delete_store`: Remove a store when it's no longer needed.
- `file_search_query`: Ask a specific question against a file search store for grounded answers.

### Deep Research
- `research_start`: Start a long-running background research task. You can ground it in your uploaded files by providing `fileSearchStoreNames`. Use `report_format` to specify the desired output structure (e.g., "Executive Brief", "Technical Deep Dive", "Comprehensive Research Report").
- `research_status`: Check if the research is done and retrieve the results.
- `research_save_report`: Once completed, save the findings as a professional Markdown report.

## Tool Dependencies & Workflow

When performing research or querying data, strictly follow this ordering:

1.  **Preparation (If files are involved)**:
    -   First, check if a suitable store exists using `file_search_list_stores`.
    -   If not, create one using `file_search_create_store`.
    -   Upload necessary files or directories using `file_search_upload`. **Crucial**: Grounding only works on files that have been successfully uploaded to a store.

2.  **Execution**:
    -   For broad, multi-step investigations: Use `research_start`.
    -   For direct questions about specific files: Use `file_search_query`.

3.  **Completion**:
    -   For deep research, use `research_status` to monitor progress.
    -   Finalize by generating a report with `research_save_report`.

Always provide the user with the Research ID or Store Name when initiating background tasks or creating resources.
